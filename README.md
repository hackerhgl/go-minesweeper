# Go minesweeper

> ## Basic implementation of minesweeper game in CLI built with golang

![Go minesweeper demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Motivation

One day I could not sleep for some reason. So, to clear out my boredom I decided to write basic random mines + counting mines for fun, Which did help to sleep that night. Also, I wanted to learn how to work with terminal UI & it was aÂ while since I wrote some go code. Well, the whole thing turns out to be a great learning experience.

## Requirements to run

> I am not sure if the old go version will work but you can try.

- Go 1.16+

## How to run

- `go run \*.go`

## How to build

> Or you can download directly from the <a href="/releases" target="_blank">release section</a> of the GitHub repository for your OS.
> If you download the binary from tags you have to chmod the binary chmod 777 ./minesweeper-macos or chmod 777 ./minesweeper-linux based on your os.

- `go build -o minesweeper`
- `./minesweeper`

## Code architecture

> This is my first time writing a small-scale go project. Please provide your feedback by raising an issue.

- `constants.go` contains shared variables
- `engine.go` contains all raw logic to calculate bombs, grid & bomb counts
- `main.go` binds `engine` with `ui`
- `models.go` contains struct
- `ui.go` contains all logic to trigger/update ui based on data
